### **Description (**Introduction - the project's aim) || Overview

This is “as the title suggest”, a simple recipe website for diffrent dishes, built with gatsby on the frontend and Contentful CMS. I allows me to upload my favorite dishes to the cloud with their recipes view them later.

It is a training project for me to learn practical usage of Gatsby.js, GraphQL and Content Management Systems. I sure did 🥳.
